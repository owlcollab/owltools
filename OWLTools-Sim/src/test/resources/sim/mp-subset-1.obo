comment: The synonym abnormal hippocampal formation is a frequently used synonym in the literature for the hippocampus. It is unfortunate that it implies a developmental process. There is also a lack of consensus relating to terms describing the hippocampus and/or the adjacent cerebral cortex with the term hippocampus sometimes referring to the hippocampal formation (or region) and sometimes only to the Ammon gyrus (Ammon's horn). In this ontology, we have used hippocampus to mean the entire formation (region).

However, this is not technically correct and we have modified this ontology to define the prenatal period to include the embryonic stages distinctly from the fetal stages. The names embryonic lethality and embryonic death have been retained as a narrow synonyms to aid in searching for those species that may use these terms as synonyms.

comment: The definition of the previous ID MP:0006008 [abnormal neurogenesis] specified only the growth or development of neurons; this is not the accepted definition of neurogenesis in GO:0022008 or most dictionary resources; these include all cells of the nervous system including glia. A new term of abnormal neuron differentiation was created that matched the definition and MP:0006008 [abnormal neurogenesis] has been merged into it.
