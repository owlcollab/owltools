For simple sequence comparisons, one should use the sequence similarity analysis evidence type. For microarray results alone, expression pattern analysis is appropriate; whereas, large-scale computational analysis should be used when microarray results are combined with the results of other types of large-scale experiments.

For simple sequence comparisons, one should use the sequence similarity analysis evidence type. For microarray results alone, expression pattern analysis is appropriate; whereas, large-scale computational analysis should be used when microarray results are combined with the results of other types of large-scale experiments.

[OBI:0000724, PMID:26000844]
comment: In Illumina sequencing technology, adapters are ligated onto the ends of randomly fragmented DNA. After single-stranded fragments are bound to the inside surface of a flow cell channel, they undergo in-place bridge PCR amplification. To begin the sequencing cycle, labeled reversible terminators, primers and DNA polymerase are added, followed by laser excitation of the fluorescent label and high resolution scanning. After non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away and the dye is chemically removed, the next cycle repeats with four labeled reversible terminators, primers and DNA polymerase, again followed by imaging.

def: "A type of high throughput nucleotide sequencing evidence in which the sequence for a ssDNA is determined by addition of primers and then nucleotides, one base pair at a time (which generate a specific fluorescence), to the target strand." [EFO:0005016]
comment: 454 pyrosequencing technology amplifies individual DNA fragments inside water droplets within an oil solution (emulsion PCR). Within each droplet, a single DNA template is attached to a single primer-coated bead. Each bead is subsequently captured in a picolitre well within the sequencing machine. A luciferase-based readout system is used to identify individual nucleotides added to the nascent DNA.\n\nThe target strand is usually prepared by fragmentation, adaptor ligation, and amplification by emulsion PCR.

[OBI:0000706]
comment: SOLiD sequencing technology is based on sequencing by ligation. After library preparation, emulsion PCR and bead enrichment are performed, including 3' modification of templates on selected beads to allow covalent bonding to a slide. 3' modified beads are attached to a glass slide and primers are added. Four fluorescently labeled di-base probes are added and multiple cycles of ligation, detection and cleavage are performed. The number of cycles determines read length. After a number of ligation cycles, the extension product is removed and another round of ligation cycles is performed with a new primer complimentary to the n-1 position of the template. Five rounds of primer reset are performed for each sequence tag.\n\nSamples are prepared by fragmentation of a sample library, adaptor ligation, emulsion PCR, and attachment of resultant beads to glass slides.

[OBI:0000695]
comment: Chain termination sequencing, also called Sanger sequencing after its developer, uses dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) as DNA chain terminators. Single-stranded DNA template, DNA primer, DNA polymerase, fluorescently or radioactively labeled nucleotides, and one of four ddNTPs are added together in each of four separate sequencing reactions. The synthesized and labeled DNA fragments from each of the four reactions are denatured, separated by size by gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography or UV light.\n\nThe ddNTPs lack an OH group so the next dNTP cannot be attached, causing chain termination.

comment: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is used to investigate protein-DNA interactions in vivo. DNA and proteins are chemically cross-linked in vivo to form chromatin complexes, followed by cell lysis and DNA shearing. Fragmented DNA-protein complexes are selectively enriched for a protein of interest using a specific antibody (immunoprecipitation). Protein digestion and DNA purification are performed prior to DNA detection via molecular cloning and sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), microarray analysis (ChIP-on-chip), or direct high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).

[ECO:MCC]
comment: Chromosome conformation capture technologies are used to study the structural properties and spatial organization of chromosomes inside cells. All types of chromosome conformation capture technology involve five primary steps: cross-linking of DNA in vivo, restriction digestion, intramolecular ligation, reversing cross-linkages, and DNA enrichment and quantitation. The last step is different for each type of chromosome conformation capture technology, and may include PCR (3C), inverse PCR (4C), or ligation-mediated amplification (5C). Methods for product quantitation can include agarose gel detection or real-time quantitative PCR in the case of 3C, or high-throughput sequencing or microarray analysis for 4C and 5C.

def: "A type of mutant phenotype evidence that uses anti-sense by introducing morpholino oligonucleotides into the cytosol of a cell." [ECO:MCC]
comment: Morpholino oligonucleotides modify gene expression by blocking access of other molecules to specific, approximately 25-base-long regions of the base-pairing surfaces of ribonucleic acid (RNA). To achieve this anti-sense knockdown technique, delivery of the morpholino can be achieved via microinjection, electroporation, or another method.

comment: SELEX begins with the synthesis of a large oligonucleotide library, either single-stranded DNA or RNA, which consists of random fixed-length sequences flanked by constant 5' and 3' ends that serve as primers. The library is exposed to a target ligand, typically a protein or small organic compound. Unbound sequences are removed, typically with affinity chromatography. Bound sequences are eluted and the nucleic acid is extracted, followed by PCR amplification (RNA is first reverse transcribed). PCR product is converted to single stranded (DNA) or transcribed (RNA). Oligonucleotides are bound to the ligand again and the process is repeated with increasing elution stringency. After several rounds of the process, recovered oligonucleotides are sequenced and analyzed to reveal the binding specificity of the protein.

comment: Bacterial one-hybrid assay is a method for screening a library of candidate proteins (prey plasmid) for the ability to bind to a target, cis-regulatory element or any other short, DNA binding sequence placed 5' to reporter genes (bait plasmid). Transformation of a bacterial host with two different plasmids is required: One is designed to express the "bait". The other plasmid contains a "prey" which, if bound to by the chimeric fusion product, drives expression of downstream reporter genes.

comment: Total RNA is isolated from cells and mRNA is purified by targeting the 3' polyadenylated (poly(A)) tail with poly(T) oligos covalently attached to a substrate. Next, cDNA fragments are generated either by hydrolysis of RNA into 200-300 base oligonucleotides, preceded by reverse transcription, or by reverse transcription initiated by random primers. The cDNA second strand is synthesized, fragments are adapter ligated and high-throughput sequencing is performed by Roche 454, Illumina, ABI-SOLiD, or another HT sequencing technology. Resulting sort reads are aligned against a reference genome, and downstream analysis is performed.

comment: Complementary DNA (cDNA) is synthesized from microgram quantities of mRNA using first-strand cDNA primer (oligo dT12-18) and reverse transcriptase in the presence of trehalose and sorbitol, followed by selection of full-length cDNA with biotinylated cap-trapper. Linkers are attached to the 5' ends of full-length enriched cDNAs to introduce a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease MmeI, which creates a two base overhang. After amplification, sequencing tags are concatenated for high-throughput sequencing. Resulting sort reads are aligned against a reference genome, and downstream analysis is performed.

def: "A type of transcript expression evidence based on high-throughput (HT) sequencing of the 5' ends of cDNA molecules that are selected by reverse transcriptase template switching." [ECO:MCC]
comment: NanoCAGE captures the 5' ends of molecules by template switching. When polymerizing the cDNA of a capped mRNA, the reverse transcriptase adds extra cytosines that are complementary to the cap. Each 5' full length cDNAs is extended upon hybridization of the riboguanosine-tailed template switching oligonucleotides to these extra cytosines. In semisuppressive PCR, the short templates fold intramolecularly and prevent the binding of primers, which precludes amplification; longer molecules are less likely to fold and are thus amplified. Templates derived from reaction artifacts form stable homoduplexes, also precluding amplification. After template switching, semisuppressive PCR, and EcoP151 cleavage, 25-bp tags are ligated to bar code-containing oligonucleotide adaptors. After PCR amplification, the nanoCAGE tags are sequenced by synthesis. NanoCAGE requires as little as 10 nanograms of total RNA.

comment: Electrophoretic mobility is a function of both the length and charge of a protein. The protein sample is linearized with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an anionic detergent. Typically, polypeptides bound with SDS possess an even distribution of charge per unit mass, and subsequent fractionation is by size.

def: "A type of support of intron positions by RNA-sequencing alignment evidence where RNA-seq alignment from a single sample supports all of the intron positions (exon pairs) predicted for a transcript." [ECO:MCC]
comment: Full support entails that all exon pairs represented in the transcript are supported. For example, for a transcript containing five exons, if liver RNA-seq reads support all four introns but brain RNA-seq supports only three introns, then the liver data fully support the transcript exons whereas the brain data do not.

comment: Partial support can occur in two ways. First, one or more exon-exon pair (intron) is not supported by any RNA-seq sample included in the analysis. Second, no single RNA-seq sample provides support for all exon-exon pairs (introns) represented in a transcript, but all represented exons are supported by at least one sample.

comment: Inference is the process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true, or alternatively, arriving at conclusions via some non-logical means of observation of patterns of facts, which can result in identifying new meanings and contexts for understanding. Given the evidence provided by a set of premises, deductive reasoning involves drawing conclusions that necessarily follow, i.e. are certain, whereas inductive reasoning generates conclusions that are likely to be, but are not necessarily, true.

def: "A type of genetic transformation evidence resulting from a change in the DNA that results in the elimination of the function of the gene, allowing for functional analysis." [PMC:2782548]
comment: A change in the DNA may result from any number of processes such (deletion, insertion, frame shift, etc.) Additionally, the gene may be made inoperative via homologous recombination, site-specific nucleases, zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), or CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats).
comment: Contrast with deletion mutation phenotypic evidence in which DNA is deleted which may result in altering the function of the resulting protein(s).

[ECO:SW, PMID:20232898]
comment: The degree of polarization of a fluorophore is inversely related to its molecular rotation. When the fluorophore is bound to a small molecule, the rate at which it tumbles can decrease significantly from when it is bound tightly to a large protein. If the fluorophore is attached to the larger protein in a binding pair, the difference in polarization between bound and unbound states will be smaller and less accurate. The degree of binding is calculated by using the difference in anisotropy of the partially bound, free, and fully bound states measured by titrating the two binding partners. Fluorescence polarixation assays are homogeneous.

def: "A type of nucleotide sequencing assay evidence in which RT-PCR (cDNA synthesis) is first used to produce a cDNA copy of a region of the RNA transcript being investigated followed by PCR to capture either the unknown 5' or 3' end of the transcript for sequencing, depending on whether 5' RACE-PCR or 3' RACE-PCR are being undertaken." [ECO:SW, PMID:17498297, PMID:7685466]
comment: 5' and 3' RACE-PCR utilize different protocols to amplify an unknown end using the known sequence of the center of the transcript.  For cDNA synthesis, 5' RACE-PCR uses an anti-sense oligonucleotide primer (gene specific primer (GSP)) that recognizes a known sequence in the middle of the gene of interest and the reverse transcriptase to add base pairs to the 3' end of the primer.  Next, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is used to add a string of identical nucleotides to the 3' end of the cDNA. A PCR reaction is then carried out, using a second anti-sense gene specific primer (GSP2) that binds to the known sequence, and a sense (forward) universal primer (UP) that binds the homopolymeric tail added to the 3' ends of the cDNAs to amplify a cDNA product from the 5' end.  In contrast, 3' RACE-PCR utilizes the naturally occurring 3' polyA tail of the transcript and uses an Oligo-dT-adaptor primer (a primer with a short sequence of deoxy-thymine nucleotides) that complements the polyA tail and adds a special adaptor sequence to the 5' end of each cDNA. PCR is then used to amplify 3' cDNA from a known region using a sense GSP, and an anti-sense primer complementary to the adaptor sequence.
comment: RACE PCR is frequently used to verify transcription start sites relevant to the function of transcription factor binding sites such as repression.

[ECO:SW, PMID:10527727]
comment: When ITC is used to study TF, the temperature of two identical cells containing a known concentration of TF is monitored. After the ligand is added to the cells in precisely measured aliquots, the temperature difference in each cell is observed to determine target binding. This value can be used to compute the energetics of the reaction and hence, binding affinity of the TF for the DNA fragment. The thermodynamic profile that is measured includes the values of binding constant (K(a)), stoichiometry (n), and the enthalpy of binding (DeltaH(b)).

comment: Differences in the optical path lengths between a surface layer and a buried silica layer can be measured very precisely allowing optical height information to be converted to accumulated mass on the surface. For the purpose of TF-binding site identification, IRIS is coupled with DNA-arrays with immobilized potential binding regions exposed to the protein of interest and eluted. Protein-bound fragments exhibit changes in reflectance that can be used to gauge binding quantitatively.

Random mutations can also be introduced via chemicals, error-prone PCR (EP-PCR), degenerate oligonucleotides-Pfu(DOP), UV irradiation, mutator strains, nucleotide analogs, or DNA recombination.

comment: Relationship type between sequences (e.g. orthologs from multiple genomes or co-expressed genes in the same genome) is not necessarily assumed. The local multiple sequence alignment is typically ungapped. A common application of motif discovery is to infer the binding motif of a given transcription factor (TF). This can be based on the results of a whole-genome expression analysis, assuming that co-expressed genes are co-regulated by the same TF, from peaks in ChIP-seq experiments with the TF, or from the comparative genomics analysis of the promoter regions of orthologs. {xref="PMID:19892760", xref="PMID:23032607"}

def: "A type of biological system reconstruction where the evidence is inferred by homology based on conservation of sequence, function, and composition from an existing experimentally supported model to a process, pathway, or complex." [ECO:SN, PMID:15660128]
comment: Inference may be based on paralogy and/or orthology of the genome-encoded components and is made primarily on functional conservation between the two systems. The sequences and number of genome-encoded components are fairly conserved but some divergence is observed. Evidence may originate from a combination of several experiments in the same or another species.

comment: There are significant differences in data analysis and data evaluation if to compare a HTP mass-spec and a regular mass-spec. The regular mass spec method is quite a reliable technique for identifying a protein molecular weight and analysing its post-modifications, other mass-spec applications might require the additional quality controls and more stringent data evaluation. More complex sample mixture is processed, more quality questions should be addressed, such as a sample contamination and sensitivity of the mass spectrometer while using HTP mass-spec.\nFor HTP mass-spec, the analysis of the small data sets allows to manually assign the spectra to proteins or peptides, but for large data sets only the statistical tools can be used instead.

def: "A type of support of intron positions by RNA-sequencing alignment evidence where RNA-seq alignments from a mixture of samples support all of the intron positions (exon pairs) predicted for a transcript." [ECO:SN]
comment: Mixed support entails that all exon pairs represented in the transcript are supported, but require a combination of evidence from multiple samples. For example, for a transcript containing five exons, if liver RNA-seq reads support the first two introns and brain RNA-seq supports the last three introns, then neither sample meets the criteria for full support (ECO:0000343) but the combination of samples qualifies as Mixed support. Mixed support may result from differential expression, or low expression levels that benefit from combining data.

[EDAM:topic\:3298, PMID:2118507]
comment: A phenome is defined as the SET of physical and biochemical traits, or, as the SET of all phenotypes expressed, i.e. a phenome is defined as the sum total of all phenotypic traits.
comment: D.S. notes: I think this term is meant to be used for high throughput experiments where a large number of mutants is screened for their ability to grow in a large number of conditions. The individual mutants can then clustered based on the similarity of their phenotypic profiles-whether they grew or didn't grow across all the conditions. The goal being to try to identify genes whose products function in the same biological pathways based on their having similar phenotypes across multiple conditions.
