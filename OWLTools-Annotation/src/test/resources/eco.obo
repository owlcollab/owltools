name: traceable author statement
def: "An author statement that is based on a cited reference." [ECO:MCC, GO:TAS]
comment: The traceable author statement (TAS) evidence code covers author statements that are attributed to a cited source. Typically this type of information comes from review articles. Material from the introductions and discussion sections of non-review papers may also be suitable if another reference is cited as the source of experimental work or analysis. When annotating with this code the curator should use caution and be aware that authors often cite papers dealing with experiments that were performed in organisms different from the one being discussed in the paper at hand. Thus a problem with the TAS code is that it may turn out from following up the references in the paper that no experiments were performed on the gene in the organism actually being characterized in the primary paper. For this reason we recommend (when time and resources allow) that curators track down the cited paper and annotate directly from the experimental paper using the appropriate experimental evidence code. When this is not possible and it is necessary to annotate from reviews, the TAS code is the appropriate code to use for statements that are associated with a cited reference. Once an annotation has been made to a given term using an experimental evidence code, we recommend removing any annotations made to the same term using the TAS evidence code.

For simple sequence comparisons, one should use the sequence similarity analysis evidence type. For microarray results alone, expression pattern analysis is appropriate; whereas, large-scale computational analysis should be used when microarray results are combined with the results of other types of large-scale experiments.

comment: The biological system in question might be a multi-step process or a physical complex comprising several components. A common basis for system reconstruction is orthology, where all of the components of an experimentally characterized complex exist in one organism; if a second organism contains orthologs of all components, then the existence of the complex is inferred. In the case of a genome-wide analysis, a gene product is said to fulfill a necessary function for a pathway or complex when, with all of the other necessary functions or components also present, the pathway or complex is reconstructed.

comment: Combinatorial analyses could include experimental or computational results. Examples include: (i) large-scale experiment such as a genome-wide two-hybrid or genome-wide synthetic interactions; (ii) integration of large-scale data sets of various types; and (iii) text-based-computation, e.g. text-mining. For simple sequence comparisons, one should use the sequence similarity analysis evidence type. For microarray results alone, expression pattern analysis is appropriate; whereas, large-scale computational analysis should be used when microarray results are combined with the results of other types of large-scale experiments.

comment: In Illumina sequencing technology, adapters are ligated onto the ends of randomly fragmented DNA. After single-stranded fragments are bound to the inside surface of a flow cell channel, they undergo in-place bridge PCR amplification. To begin the sequencing cycle, labeled reversible terminators, primers and DNA polymerase are added, followed by laser excitation of the fluorescent label and high resolution scanning. After non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away and the dye is chemically removed, the next cycle repeats with four labeled reversible terminators, primers and DNA polymerase, again followed by imaging.

Within each droplet, a single DNA template is attached to a single primer-coated bead. Each bead is subsequently captured in a picolitre well within the sequencing machine. A luciferase-based readout system is used to identify individual nucleotides added to the nascent DNA.

comment: SOLiD sequencing technology is based on sequencing by ligation. After library preparation, emulsion PCR and bead enrichment are performed, including 3' modification of templates on selected beads to allow covalent bonding to a slide. 3' modified beads are attached to a glass slide and primers are added. Four fluorescently labeled di-base probes are added and multiple cycles of ligation, detection and cleavage are performed. The number of cycles determines read length. After a number of ligation cycles, the extension product is removed and another round of ligation cycles is performed with a new primer complimentary to the n-1 position of the template. Five rounds of primer reset are performed for each sequence tag.

comment: Chain termination sequencing, also called Sanger sequencing after its developer, uses dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) as DNA chain terminators. Single-stranded DNA template, DNA primer, DNA polymerase, fluorescently or radioactively labeled nucleotides, and one of four ddNTPs are added together in each of four separate sequencing reactions. The synthesized and labeled DNA fragments from each of the four reactions are denatured, separated by size by gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography or UV light.

comment: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is used to investigate protein-DNA interactions in vivo. DNA and proteins are chemically cross-linked in vivo to form chromatin complexes, followed by cell lysis and DNA shearing. Fragmented DNA-protein complexes are selectively enriched for a protein of interest using a specific antibody (immunoprecipitation). Protein digestion and DNA purification are performed prior to DNA detection via molecular cloning and sequencing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), microarray analysis (ChIP-on-chip), or direct high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).

comment: Chromosome conformation capture technologies are used to study the structural properties and spatial organization of chromosomes inside cells. All types of chromosome conformation capture technology involve five primary steps: cross-linking of DNA in vivo, restriction digestion, intramolecular ligation, reversing cross-linkages, and DNA enrichment and quantitation. The last step is different for each type of chromosome conformation capture technology, and may include PCR (3C), inverse PCR (4C), or ligation-mediated amplification (5C). Methods for product quantitation can include agarose gel detection or real-time quantitative PCR in the case of 3C, or high-throughput sequencing or microarray analysis for 4C and 5C.

For simple sequence comparisons, one should use the sequence similarity analysis evidence type. For microarray results alone, expression pattern analysis is appropriate; whereas, large-scale computational analysis should be used when microarray results are combined with the results of other types of large-scale experiments.

comment: Morpholino oligonucleotides modify gene expression by blocking access of other molecules to specific, approximately 25-base-long regions of the base-pairing surfaces of ribonucleic acid (RNA). To achieve this anti-sense knockdown technique, delivery of the morpholino can be achieved via microinjection, electroporation, or another method.

comment: SELEX begins with the synthesis of a large oligonucleotide library, either single-stranded DNA or RNA, which consists of random fixed-length sequences flanked by constant 5' and 3' ends that serve as primers. The library is exposed to a target ligand, typically a protein or small organic compound. Unbound sequences are removed, typically with affinity chromatography. Bound sequences are eluted and the nucleic acid is extracted, followed by PCR amplification (RNA is first reverse transcribed). PCR product is converted to single stranded (DNA) or transcribed (RNA). Oligonucleotides are bound to the ligand again and the process is repeated with increasing elution stringency. After several rounds of the process, recovered oligonucleotides are sequenced and analyzed to reveal the binding specificity of the protein.

comment: Bacterial one-hybrid assay is a method for screening a library of candidate proteins (prey plasmid) for the ability to bind to a target, cis-regulatory element or any other short, DNA binding sequence placed 5' to reporter genes (bait plasmid). Transformation of a bacterial host with two different plasmids is required: One is designed to express the "bait". The other plasmid contains a "prey" which, if bound to by the chimeric fusion product, drives expression of downstream reporter genes.

comment: Total RNA is isolated from cells and mRNA is purified by targeting the 3' polyadenylated (poly(A)) tail with poly(T) oligos covalently attached to a substrate. Next, cDNA fragments are generated either by hydrolysis of RNA into 200-300 base oligonucleotides, preceded by reverse transcription, or by reverse transcription initiated by random primers. The cDNA second strand is synthesized, fragments are adapter ligated and high-throughput sequencing is performed by Roche 454, Illumina, ABI-SOLiD, or another HT sequencing technology. Resulting sort reads are aligned against a reference genome, and downstream analysis is performed.

comment: cDNA is synthesized from microgram quantities of mRNA using first-strand cDNA primer (oligo dT12-18) and reverse transcriptase in the presence of trehalose and sorbitol, followed by selection of full-length cDNA with biotinylated cap-trapper. Linkers are attached to the 5' ends of full-length enriched cDNAs to introduce a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease MmeI, which creates a two base overhang. After amplification, sequencing tags are concatenated for high-throughput sequencing. Resulting sort reads are aligned against a reference genome, and downstream analysis is performed.

def: "A type of transcript expression evidence based on high-throughput (HT) sequencing of the 5' ends of cDNA molecules that are selected by reverse transcriptase template switching." [ECO:MCC]
comment: NanoCAGE captures the 5' ends of molecules by template switching. When polymerizing the cDNA of a capped mRNA, the reverse transcriptase adds extra cytosines that are complementary to the cap. Each 5' full length cDNAs is extended upon hybridization of the riboguanosine-tailed template switching oligonucleotides to these extra cytosines. In semisuppressive PCR, the short templates fold intramolecularly and prevent the binding of primers, which precludes amplification; longer molecules are less likely to fold and are thus amplified. Templates derived from reaction artifacts form stable homoduplexes, also precluding amplification. After template switching, semisuppressive PCR, and EcoP151 cleavage, 25-bp tags are ligated to bar code-containing oligonucleotide adaptors. After PCR amplification, the nanoCAGE tags are sequenced by synthesis. NanoCAGE requires as little as 10 nanograms of total RNA.
