name: apoptosis
namespace: biological_process
def: "A form of programmed cell death induced by external or internal signals that trigger the activity of proteolytic caspases, whose actions dismantle the cell and result in cell death. Apoptosis begins internally with condensation and subsequent fragmentation of the cell nucleus (blebbing) while the plasma membrane remains intact. Other characteristics of apoptosis include DNA fragmentation and the exposure of phosphatidyl serine on the cell surface." [GOC:go_curators, ISBN:0198506732]

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.
