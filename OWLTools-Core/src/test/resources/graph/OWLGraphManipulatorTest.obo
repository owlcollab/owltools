comment: the is_a relation to the root should be removed when testing filterSubgraphs(Collection), not the term itself. Also, part_of relation to the root is redundant and should be removed when calling reduceRelations(). It is also use for a propagation test when using removeClassAndPropagateEdges(String) on FOO:0004.

comment: term part of the subgraph to remove, should be removed. Relations to subgraph2_A should NOT be removed when testing reduceRelations(), as the direct relation is more precise (part_of) than the combined one (overlaps).

comment: term part of both the subgraph to remove, and a subgraph to keep, should NOT be removed. It is a sibling of the root of the subgraph to be removed, and also one of its descendant. Also, relation is_a to the root is redundant and should be removed by reduceRelations(). It should also be removed by reducePartOfAndSubClassOfRelations().
